# Prelim Summative Activity: Descriptive Analytics with Data Preprocessing

## DataMiners

#### PROGRAMMERS:

- GALLEGOS, Davon George
- MANIEGO, Ralph
- PARALLAG, Shawn
- REGATON, Redgi
- TAGORDA, Anthony I.
- VALENZUELA, Kyle Christian

### Objectives

- to determine the types of variables and different levels / scales of measurement from a data
set in order to provide statistical information
- to utilize critical thinking in data exploration and data preprocessing of dirty data
in preparation for analysis
- to make appropriate data representations in tabular and graphical form
- to perform descriptive analysis

### Tools
- Python and Spreadsheet Software

### Tasks
1. The team is expected to process 1000 rows. However, the team should initially look for data
sets that require some preparation prior to analysis.
   - Check for extraneous columns, duplicates, inconsistent data / formats and others.
   - The team must then “clean” the data and extract the 1000 rows needed for analysis. 
   - The team is expected to investigate alternatives until a final data set is chosen. 
   - Use a combination of manual and automated techniques to investigate and prepare your data set.
2. Apply the descriptive analytics concepts learned thus far. Use the different measures
discussed.
   - Measures of Central Tendency 
   - Measures of Relative Location 
   - Measures of Dispersion 
   - Measures of Correlation
3. Utilize both spreadsheet software and Python.
      - **Single-column**: Utilize descriptive statistics to characterize your data (5 distinct  statistics)
      - **Multiple-columns and column / statistical relationships:** Utilize descriptive statistics to characterize your data (5 distinct statistics)
      - Data representations that range from simple to advanced with reasonable variety and applicability.

      | Stem-and-Leaf                | Choropleth Map                     |
      | Histogram                    |                                    |



### Deliverables
1. 
   1. Raw data set **_(cybersecurity_attacks.csv)_**
   2. Document containing the following: **_(DataMiners-PrelimSummativeAct.pdf)_**
      - a brief description of the team’s “journey” in data collection and data exploration
      - the data analysis process. This includes some of the components of the Data Analytics Process:
      1. Purpose
      2. Questions
      3. Data Collection
      4. Data Analysis Procedures and Methods
      5. Interpretation/Identification of Findings
   3. Spreadsheet that contains the clean data and the worksheets that contain the data
   analysis results. **_(DataMiners-PrelimSummativeAct.xlsx)_**
2. Archive the file and upload it in the designated assignment inbox in Google Classroom.
